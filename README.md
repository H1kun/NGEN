# NitroGen
Generates + Checks Discord Nitro codes

It is unlikely you will generate a working code but worth a try.



I did not originally create this project but I fixed + adapted it.

This is PURELY proof of concept!!!



To use:
1. Open proxies.txt and paste in your fresh http:port proxies
2. Run install.bat to install packages
3. Run NGEN.py
4. Follow the onscreen menu!
